This is a 2 players pong game made in python with the Turtle module. Player 1 has to use w to move up and s to down, player 2 has to use upper and lower arrow for the respective movements. Each time a player misses the ball, other player gets a point. Each time any player rebounds the ball using paddle, the speed of the paddle increases slightly. And for the bonus thing if a player can time their ball correctly to hit the top or bottom of their paddle, the ball goes through it and it increases the speed of the ball significantly.
